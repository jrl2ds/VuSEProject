# SMS Catalog 

The goal of my project shall be to create a texting app that offers the ability to obtain more information about the course catalog from a student. 
Students can submit major names or course titles to the Course catalog, and they will get respones that can offer useful information such as course
descrpitions, major requirements, and more. 

This project stems from the requirement that it be offered via text messaging. This shall all be done via text interface, and the user can simply text the server
to obtain the information they are looking for. There are a variety of extra goals for the project, including making it easier for the user to find out info about
their courses, to obtain info about course requirements when the internet or a pdf reader isn't visible, and making it easy to store a record of the information 
they care about most, by checking their texts. 

Possible additions include pulling information from rate my professor, allowing profiles that might save user data about courses taken, and providing info about
when a course might be offered, or when it was previously offered. This information will likely require a database that is contsructed from Vanderbilt's YES page, 
which because it doens't offer an API, will likely require offline construction of the database.

# Answers: 
## Question 1:
F: He goes through a strenuous process of figuring out where. I’m a chemical engineer, so there’s no good website that tells me what the graduation requirements are. I usually just contact my advisor, or comb through the website. Once you find the info though, it’s easy. 
M: I go to the undergraduate catalog and look up the course requirements. I often would check it when I was making plans for my double major. Sometimes I use the degree audit on YES. 
A: I’m not completely sure how I go about it for each time. I know the math requirements are on the math website, and I suppose I would look at the website of a respective major for those requirements, although I’ve found them to be out of date or hard to obtain sometimes. I know YES can let you do that, but only for your current major. 

## Question 2:
F: Generally, I base it off the graduation requirements that I find from the pdf I found on the chem E website, or I go to my advisor. I also check what classes are open when I try to register. I tend to check minors as well.
M: I tend to coordinate info from what classes I’ve taken, recommendation of my fellow students and professors, courses open in the upcoming semester from the course catalog, requirements of my major, I usually have to eliminate a few prospective classes as a result of scheduling conflict, since a lot of classes are only offered at some times. I also talk to my advisor
A: One annoying thing about this, is that we have no way of knowing what classes will be open when I try to register. They are 

##Question 3:
F: It depends, I honestly don’t know. I’d probably google it, or contact a professor.
M: From the undergraduate catalog, or degree audit
A: I’m not entirely sure. Probably from the website for the major I’m interested in, maybe it’s somewhere in yes, and there is the catalog. 

## Question 4:
F:  Very accurate. Well actually, it depends on the advisor. In my personal experience, I had an advisor who wasn’t the best, and he didn’t provide good information, or vague information, but then I got a good advisor who provides very detailed info and different avenues of approach to meeting all my requirements
M: I’ve found it to be inaccurate. My advisor kinda sucks, and has a poor idea of what my majors requirements are, and has absolutely no idea the requirements or difficulty of adding a given minor or other major.
A: My advisor gives accurate info about my requirements, although it is limited in scope to my major, and usually doesn’t have all the details about what a course is like. My advisor actually had no idea what some of the classes I took were about.

## Question 5:
F: Usually I would have to go to the YES page, that uhh, has all the course listings, and find the individual or specific course, and find information that correlates from that. 
M: I would look it up in the Course Catalog, ask other students about the class, maybe ask my advisor, and look up the description in the YES page.
A: I would probably look it up on yes, going to course registration to find out information about the course. One annoying this is about how we can’t get syllabus’s. 

## Question 6:
F: Nah. It is not convenient. I would expect it to all be within the same platform. Say for instance, when I go onto the course catalog (He is referring to Yes Course Registration), I would see a list of all the courses I have taken, or need to take. (Notably, YES does provide this info)
M: It’s only convenient for your current major, it’s very inconvenient for figuring out requirements of other majors or other minors
A: No it’s not convenient, although it is effective. There is a lot of information out there, and most of it is easy to find, it’s just time consuming to cross reference over several websites. 

## Question 7:
F: it’s fine. Student registration is done moderately right, you just have to type in the course number, and you get the info about it. 
M: Not really. It would be easier if the information about what courses are was available when I was learning about the need to take those courses, not having to cross reference different websites
A: It’s convenient enough, YES gives me descriptions of courses that are open next semester. 

## Question 8:
F: oh no, absolutely not. It was very difficult to get information about it before I had access to yes. It was literally impossible, I have no idea where to find that info. 
M: Somewhat, I used the Course Catalog, and I think Vanderbilt might have sent me some of the info.
A: It was a lot harder, as I didn’t have YES, so I had no idea what courses were offered. 

## Question 9:
F: Ratemyprofessor is very very nice, to have it where I can use it with course information, so I can figure out what professors are best for a course. 
M: A more robust way of planning out classes over the semesters. It ca be hard to tell what classes are offered which semesters, without simply being told in advance. This can make graduating on time difficult.
A: Easier to use, I already have most of the features I need. 

## Question 10:
F:  On the Yes Catalog page? 
M: Probably a central place that would tell me about the different course requirements I have, how many I’ve completed, and the courses in the upcoming semester that could contribute to them.
A: An app-like calendar that had tabs for all the different options would be nice.
